# Magic number game!

# I want you to use operators

# equate something



# As a user, I want to be able to guess a number and know if i got it correct or not, so that I can know if I won or not.





# We should define/assign number to a variable called magic_number

magic_number = 10



# I need to ask user for input

guess = input("Guess what number's in my head ")



# I need to check if this input matches a magic_number


if int(guess) == magic_number:
    print("Wow! You're psychic")
else:
    print("Uh-oh, wrong answer!")

# I need to let the user know if the response was write or not
