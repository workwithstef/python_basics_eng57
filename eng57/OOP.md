# All things Object-Oriented

### 4 Pillars of OOP
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

#### Abstraction
- Not revealing the specific mechanisms which allow to object to operate
- E.g having a coffee machine which has flashing lights and makes noises, BUT is operable by the simple push of a button.
- E.g Like a smartphone. It is ergonomic and has straight-forward user options, but you don't need to know exactly how each mechanism works

- in OOP you should create the class, its methods & attributes in a separate file. Then create and use the instance(s) in another file
